## Hi there, I'm Ujjwal 👋

I'm a 3rd-year B.Tech CS student at KIIT University. I research and build ML/NLP tools that help people read and understand research and computational math and code.

**Current focus:** Bridge Complexity / “A Fistful of Problems”; NLP for research assistants; explainable code tools.

- 📄 Papers: *A Fistful of Problems* (preprint)
- 🛠️ Projects: ArxAst (paper-reading assistant)
- 🔭 Exploring: average-case complexity, transformer models for summarisation
